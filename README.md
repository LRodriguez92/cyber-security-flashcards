- **User Authentication**: Sign in with email/password, Google, or continue as guest
- **Progress Synchronization**: Your progress is automatically synced across devices
- **Confidence Pile Consistency**: Your confidence ratings are synchronized between all your devices
- **Offline Support**: Continue studying even without an internet connection
- **User Profiles**: Manage your account and preferences

## Cybersecurity Domains

- **Blue - General Security Concepts**: CIA triad, AAA framework, Zero Trust, security controls

2. Set up Firebase (optional but recommended for full features):
   - Follow the [Firebase Setup Guide](FIREBASE_SETUP.md) to configure authentication and database
   - Create a `.env.local` file with your Firebase configuration

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the local development URL

5. Click "Sign In" in the top right to create an account or sign in

## Technologies Used

- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React (for icons)
- Vite (build tool)
- Firebase (authentication & database)
- Framer Motion (animations)

## Usage

1. Select the domains you want to study using the domain filter buttons
2. Click on a flashcard to flip it and reveal the answer
3. Rate your confidence level using the buttons that appear after flipping
4. Navigate through cards using the Previous/Next buttons
5. Use the Reset Quiz button to start over
6. View your progress and confidence tracking in real-time

## Synchronization Features

The app automatically synchronizes your progress across all devices:

- **Automatic Sync**: Changes are automatically synced to the cloud when you rate your confidence
- **Cross-Device Consistency**: Your confidence piles remain consistent between devices
- **Offline Support**: Changes made offline are queued and synced when you're back online
- **Manual Sync**: Use the "Sync Data" button in your profile menu to manually trigger synchronization
- **Sync Status**: Visual indicators show when data is being synced or if there are any issues

## Troubleshooting Sync Issues

If your confidence piles aren't syncing between devices:

1. Make sure you're signed in with the same account on both devices
2. Check your internet connection
3. Try manually syncing using the "Sync Data" button in your profile menu
4. Look for sync status indicators in the header and bottom-right corner
5. If issues persist, try signing out and back in

The app provides a comprehensive learning experience for cybersecurity professionals and students preparing for certifications or interviews.
